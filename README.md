#Jitter test for overfitting

Jitter_Test_for_Overfitting.ipynb notebook demonstrate some intuition about possible testing of models for overfitting.

Sample models are taken from "Supervised learning superstitions cheat sheet"

+ Logistic regression
+ Decision trees
+ Support vector machines

Trained on various versions of the "two moons" dataset and plot empirical decision boundaries. 

JTO applied to regression model.
Comparison to Cross Validation added.

TL/DR : JOT gives small improvement over Cross Validation. Computational speed of JOT is slower than CV.
